## Goals

This RFC propose the model of communication between a wallet daemon and tapplets in Tari Universe.

## Introduction

Tari Universe should be built using with [Tauri](https://tauri.app/) which will include a OS process with wallet daemon and root frame which hosts dashboard and has TypeScript provider for communication with wallet. This root frame also hosts tapplets in _\<iframe /\>_ as it's own children and serves as a intermediary between those tapplets and wallet daemon.

## Wallet daemon

A normal wallet daemon requires a webRTC communication which is establish through a signaling server that connect incoming requests with matching requests IDs. In this case communication will happen on the same host so we can simplify by utilizing inter process communication (IPC).

**Wallet daemon IPC** entity that holds a reference to initialized wallet daemon running in background will server as mediatory between chromium and wallet daemon.

## Root Frame - Tapplet Communication

Root frame and it's child tapplets should communicate through **window.postMessage(request, targetOrigin)** and **window.addEventListener("message",handler)**.

**request** should be an object of type:

```Typescript
interface Request {
   methodName: keyof TariProvider,
   args: unknown[]
   id: number
}
```

Id is an unique identifier for tapplets requests to distinguish incoming requests.

Response should be raw object from Tari provider.

## Root frame

Root frame initialize it's own provider that implements **TariProvider** which should look like as follow:

```Typescript
interface TariProvider {
  providerName: string;
  isConnected(): boolean;
  getAccount(): Promise<Account>;
  getSubstate(substate_address: string): Promise<Substate>;
  submitTransaction(
    req: SubmitTransactionRequest
  ): Promise<SubmitTransactionResponse>;
  getTransactionResult(transactionId: string): Promise<TransactionResult>;
  getTemplateDefinition(template_address: string): Promise<Template>;
}
```

This provider should now communicate with wallet daemon.

To receive requests from tapplet, root frame should register an event listener for incoming requests, the rough implementation for React app should look like this:

```Typescript
useEffect(() => {
    const handleMessage = async (event) => {
      const result = await provider[event.methodName](event.args);
      event.source.postMessage({ id: event.id, result }, event.origin);
    };

    window.addEventListener("message", handleMessage, false);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener("message", handleMessage);
    };
  }, []);
```

## Tapplets

Tapplet should communicate with it's root frame with **window.parent.postMessage(request,windowParentOrigin)** but typing this every request would a hassle so my suggestion is to use some wrapper that handles communication to the root frame:

```Typescript
let __id = 0; // global sequence

async function providerWrapper(req: Omit<Request, "id">) {
  return new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
    const id = ++__id;

    const event_ref = function (resp) {
      if (resp && resp.data && resp.data.id && resp.data.id == id) {
        window.removeEventListener("message", event_ref);
        resolve(resp.data);
      }
    };
    window.addEventListener("message", event_ref, false);

    window.parent.postMessage({...req, id}, rootFrameOrigin);
  });
}
```

`rootFrameOrigin` should be a variable that hold it's root frame origin. Best practice is to get it from another `postMessage(..)` call and cache it.

Now tapplet simply needs to call this wrapper and as bonus we get correct typing for all the methods available in the Tari provider.

```Typescript
async function getAccountData() {
   const res = await providerWrapper({methodName: "getAccount", args: []});
   return res;
}
```
