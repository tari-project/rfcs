## Goals

Many dapps and web3 enabled applications require the ability to spend or interact with the assets
that a user owns on their behalf. Ethereum and many other blockchains achieve this in a stateful
manner by invoking methods such as 'approve' and 'approve_all' in ERC20 and ERC721. Being stateful, 
the user must spend fees in order to add or revoke permissions. When fees are high, or due to 
simplistic user interfaces, a user will often grant a much higher level of permission than is required. 
For example, the user may approve a service to transfer all of their funds, or all of their NFTs.

The scheme proposed by this RFC is a stateless token that the bearer can use to invoke methods on the 
DAN layer.

## Description

This scheme is inspired by [Macaroons](https://www.ndss-symposium.org/ndss2014/programme/macaroons-cookies-contextual-caveats-decentralized-authorization-cloud/) in that it allows the bearer of a token to delegate a more restrictive token to
another bearer. 


## Structure

### Auth Token

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| root_nonce | bytes(32) (optional) | a base ID used to revoke permissions(see below)  | 
| expires_at_height | u64 (optional) | the sidechain height at which this token expires. Timestamps are not reliable in blockchains, so height is used in this case |
| granted_to | pubkey | the public key of the grantee. Any bearer using this token will need to prove knowledge of the private key |
| scopes | string[] | A list of scopes granted to this scope |
| caveats | CaveatExpression[] | An ordered list of caveats |
| based_on | Token (optional) | If this token is derived from another token, it should be present here |
| issuer | PubKey | the issuer of this token |
| issuer_sig | Signature | a signature signed by `issuer` of the challenge `Hash(root_nonce + granted_to + scopes + caveats + expires_at_height + based_on + issuer )` |

### Caveat Expression

``` 
Caveat Expression = <Field> <operator> <Argument>
```

Field: An arbitrary string that will be interpreted by the code
Operator: OneOf("eq", "le", "lt","ge", "gt")
Argument: A constant value, to be interpreted by the code

Examples
```
amount lt 1000
token_id eq 4759
```

## Delegation

A bearer of a token may grant another identity a more specific token, provided that the scopes and caveats are more restrictive.


## Validation

The root_nonce, if specified must match the root nonce on record for the issuer.
> Open question: should root nonce just be a special caveat?

Before starting execution of the instruction, the list of auth tokens must be validated to ensure that each token is more restrictive than
the last.

When executing instructions, caveats MUST be checked if they are relevant to the resources being acted upon. 
For example, if a function requires a scope `transfer`, the most specific AuthToken must have that scope present.



## Revoking Tokens
Each contract SHOULD store a root nonce for each identity in the contract. To revoke a set of tokens, an identity owner
may change their root nonce. This will revoke all tokens based on this root.

### Example 1: Invoking an instruction

In this example, Alice wants to allow Bob to spend 100 of a fungible asset called `WARI` from her account.

Let's assume the transfer function looks like this:


```
fn transfer(amount: u64, from: PublicKey, to: PublicKey) 
{
   requires_scope("transfer", from);
   ...
}
```

Alice creates a token:
```json5
/* bob's token */
{
   "scopes": ["transfer"],
   "granted_to": "<Bob's Public Key>",
   "caveats": [
      "amount le 100"
   ],
   "issuer": "<Alice's Public Key>",
   "issuer_sig": "<sig>"
}
```

> Note: The `root_nonce` and `expires_at_height` are missing here, but it would have been better for Alice to include these.
> Also, this token allows Bob to spend up to 100 at a time, but does not restrict Bob from using this token again

Bob can now create the instruction and submit it to the validator node. The validator node checks that the instruction signature
matches the public key in `granted_to` and also checks that the `amount` parameter is less than or equal to 100. Finally, the
validator node checks that the scope includes 'transfer', and Alice's public key (specified in `from`) matches the auth token's issuer signature.

### Example 2: Delegation
Let's continue the example, but in this case Bob wants to allow Carol to spend the funds.

In this case, Bob creates a token for Carol with the following:

```json5
/* carol's token */
{
   "scopes": ["transfer"],
   "granted_to": "<Carol's Public Key",
   "caveats": [
      "amount le 90"
   ],
   "issuer": "<Bob's Public Key>",
   "issuer_sig": "<sig>",
   "based_on": {
      /* bob's token */
   }
}
```


Carol can now create a set of instructions, attach the token and sign it with her public key.

```json
{
   "instructions": [
      {
         "method": "transfer",
         "amount": "80",
         "from": "<alice's pub key>",
         "to": "<carol's pub key>"
      },
      {
         "method": "transfer",
         "amount": "10",
         "from": "<alice's pub key>",
         "to": "<bob's pub key>"
      }
   ],
   "authority": {
      "bearer": {/* carol's token */},
      "sig": "<sig with carol's pub key>"
   }
}
```

When the validator node receives a set of instructions with this token, it must process each token recursively, with respect to
the token it is based on.
