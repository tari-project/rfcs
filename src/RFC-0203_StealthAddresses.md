## Goals

This Request for Comment (RFC) presents a design for a one-time (stealth) address protocol useful for one-sided payments
to improve recipient privacy for payments on the Tari base layer.

## Introduction

The Tari protocol extends the [Mimblewimble] protocol to include scripting in the form of [TariScript]. One of the 
first features implemented using [TariScript] was [one-sided payments]. These are payments to a recipient that do not 
require an interactive negotiation in the same way a standard [Mimblewimble] transaction does. One of the main downsides
of the current implementation of [one-sided payments] is that the script key used is the public key of the recipient's 
wallet. This public key is embedded in the [TariScript] of the [UTXO] created by the sender. The issue is that it becomes
very easy for a third party to scan the blockchain to look for one-sided transaction outputs being sent to a given wallet. 
In order to alleviate this privacy leak, this RFC proposes the use of one-time (stealth) addresses to be used as the script
key when sending a one-sided payment.

## Background

Stealth addresses were first proposed on the Bitcoin Talk forum by user [Bytecoin]. The concept was further refined by
[Peter Todd], using a design similar to the [BIP-32] style of address generation. In this approach, the sender can use an
ephemerial public key (derived from a nonce) to perform a non-interactive Diffie-Hellman exchange with the recipient's
public key, and use this to derive a one-time public key to which only the recipient can derive the corresponding private
key. This reduces on-chain linkability (but, importantly, does not eliminate it).

The approach was further extended in the [CryptoNote] whitepaper to support a dual-key design, whereby a separate scanning
key is also used in the one-time address construction; this enables identification of outputs, but requires the spending
key to derive the private key required to spend the output.

It is important to note that while one-time addresses are not algebraically linkable, it is possible to observe transactions
that consume multiple such outputs and infer common ownership of them.

For use in Tari, single-key one-time addresses are supported.

## One-time (stealth) addresses

Single-key one-time stealth addresses require only that a recipient possess a private key \\( a \\) and corresponding public
key \\( A = a \cdot G \\), and distribute the public key out of band to receive [one-sided payments] in a non-interactive
manner.

The protocol that a sender will use to make a payment to the recipient is as follows:
1. Generate a random nonce \\( r \\) and use it to produce an ephemeral public key \\( R = r \cdot G \\).
2. Compute a Diffie-Hellman exchange to obtain the shared secret \\( c = H( r \cdot A ) \\), where \\( H \\) is a cryptographic
hash function.
3. Include \\( K_S = c \cdot G + A \\) as the last public key in a [one-sided payment] script in a transaction.
4. Include \\( R \\) in the script for use by the recipient, but drop it so it is not used in script execution.
This changes the script for a [one-sided payment] from `PushPubkey(K_S)` to `PushPubkey(R) Drop PushPubkey(K_S)`.

To identify [one-sided payments], the recipient scans the blockchain for outputs containing a [one-sided payment] script. It
then does the following to test for ownership:
1. Extract the ephemeral public key \\( R \\) from the script.
2. Compute a Diffie-Hellman exchange to obtain the shared secret \\( c = H( a \cdot R ) \\).
3. Compute \\( K_S' = c \cdot G + A \\).
If \\( K_S' = K_S \\) is included in the script, the recipient can produce the required script signature using the corresponding
one-time private key \\( c + a \\).
