## Goals

The goal of this RFC is to describe the process for allocating Validator Nodes (VNs) to Validator Node Committees (VNCs)

## Intro

Validator nodes will have to group themselves into Validator Node Committees (VNC) for transactions/shard processing.
Committees will be formed for each new transaction/shard processing. This committee needs to be determined
pseudo-randomly, and we use the VN_Key as this changes periodically and is pseudorandom. Each VN will be allocated a
unique and individual shard space to serve in as a VNC member.

## Requirements

In order to ensure that VNCs are selected securely and can operate successfully, we pin down the following requirements:

1. A percentage of the nodes must change to a new shard space every epoch (e.g. exactly 25%)
2. A VN must not be able to determine its own shard space location ahead of time, i.e. the VN only knows it's new
   location once the block with the new epoch is mined.
3. It must be easy, e.g. ùìû(log n), to calculate the VN set. (You should have to replay all shuffles to calculate the
   current VN set).
4. A VN must be able to be part of a committee for a certain period to allow time to sync state, before being
   penalised (if applicable) for not participating in consensus.
5. Open Question: Should there be a limit (e.g. 10%) in the number of nodes that can join per epoch

## VN-key expiry

Each new VN will get a [VN-key] on registration. This key will expire on some pseudorandom height. This is calculated as
follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Expire height} = \text{(Current block height)} + \text{(min expire height)} + \text{new VN-pubkey } MOD \text{ (
max expire height)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Every time a new VN-Key is assigned a new expiry date is calculated. Because the [miner]s calculate the VN-key, they
also calculate the new VN-key every time
it expires.

# Process of choosing committees when an instruction needs to be processed

For each instruction, the substates involved in this instruction **MUST** be known before they can be processed.
For each involved substate, the address of the substate is mapped to a shard. For each shard, the VN committee is
constructed from `COMMITTEE_SIZE/2` VNs to the left and right of the shard,
in the [VNKey Merkle tree].

Thus, a single instruction will have a maximum N * `COMMITTEE_SIZE` validator nodes processing it, when N is the number
of involved substates.

## Committee Creation
                       
<div class="note">

Because we have the base layer where each VN needs to publish a registration transaction, we can get base_node and
miners to keep track of all active VNs. We represent all VNs in a (balanced) Merkle tree with the VN_keys as leaves. We
declare a constant `COMMITTEE_SIZE` which can be changed in the consensus constants.

For the sake of simplicity, `COMMITTEE_SIZE` MUST be an even positive integer.

As per the Cerberus algorithm, validator nodes are responsible for managing _sub-states_, rather than contract
semantics.
A given instruction may involve dozens of sub-states, meaning that there are potentially dozens of non-overlapping
committees that are required to reach a braided consensus.

Each committee is determined independently. For each sub-state, a committee is formed by taking the
first  `COMMITTEE_SIZE / 2` VN_keys to the left and `COMMITTEE_SIZE / 2` VN_Keys to the right of the sub-state's shard
address in the merkle tree.

This makes it very easy to determine what shard space a VN needs to serve, which states the VN needs to sync from peers,
and who has them. Because the
second layer has a delayed view of the network. VNs can also know beforehand and prep to ensure they are ready when new
block heights appear.

An important edge case here that is implied but not listed, is that if the whole network is less or equal to
the `COMMITTEE_SIZE`, then the whole network participates in the VNC.

## Committee proofs

We construct the balanced Merkle tree from all active VN registration transactions and prune away all inactive ones.
Because the [base node]s have to keep track
of the entire unspent UTXO set, it becomes easy for them to track and validate all active VN registration UTXOs. This
means we can keep [base node]s
responsible for validating and constructing the Merkle tree. We commit this Merkle tree per block as a Merkle root
inside the block's header as the `validator_node_set_root`.

This Merkle root in the header always lags by one block, meaning that the Merkle root is for the state of the VN's
before the start of the block it's mined in.
When a VN registers, that new VN key will only appear inside the Merkle tree in the next block. The reason for this is
that header_hash is used in the
the calculation process of the VN_key.

### Option 2 for Committee proofs

The VN_key needs some random entropy that's not minable to ensure that a VN cannot choose its VN_key. This random
entropy is currently the block hash of the
block the VN registration was mined in. Hence the reason for the Merkle root lagging by one block. If we change this
entropy value be another source of
randomness, such as the `utxo_merkle_root`, then we don't have to do the lag by 1, and it can all be calculated in the
single block.

## Leader selection

The VNC leader should not be decided beforehand and must be chosen pseudorandomly only when a tx is published. We also
need to select an order of leaders
in the case, the first leader is offline/and or not responsive.

$$
\begin{aligned}
vn\_position\_hash(vn, tx) = Hash(vn.signing_key || hash(tx))
\end{aligned}
$$

This will give a sortable list we use to order the VNs for leader selection.
