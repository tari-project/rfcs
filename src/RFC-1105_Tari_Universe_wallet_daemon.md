## Goals

This goal of this RFC is to describe details of the wallet daemon running in the background of Tari Universe. Its stores and handles transaction made by a user.

## Current wallet implementation

The standalone wallet daemon right now connects using webRTC protocol which requires signaling server to connect peers. It ensures secure and private communication but as downside it also requires interactive connection establishment.

## Adapting for Tari Universe

In our case the webRTC is redundant as both wallet daemon and tapplet runs on the same host machine. The best option is to utilize [tauri inter process communication (IPC)](https://beta.tauri.app/concepts/inter-process-communication/) which is made of commands and events.
It's a big simplification both from developer perspective as for user as he no longer cares whether the connection was established or not.

## Architecture overview

The wallet daemon is made of IPC commands handler that is also a main thread that spawns 2 processes running in the background:

- Transaction service
- Account monitor

Communication will be handled by MPSC channels, each process will have a channel for inputs and outputs to send and receive events from the main thread.

![wallet daemon architecture overview](assets/wallet_daemon_architecture.svg)

Both the TransactionService and AccountMonitor are created and spawned as background tasks in the `spawn_services` function. The `spawn_services` function takes in various parameters, including a Notify object for wallet events, and the wallet SDK. It returns a `Services` struct that contains the handles to the spawned tasks (transaction_service_handle and account_monitor_handle) as well as a future (services_fut) that represents the combined execution of both tasks.

### Transaction service

The TransactionService is responsible for managing and processing transactions. It interacts with the wallet SDK (DanWalletSdk) to perform operations such as creating transactions, signing them, and submitting them to the network. It also relies on a Notify object to receive notifications about wallet events. The TransactionService runs in its own background task using tokio::spawn and has a handle (transaction_service_handle) that can be used to interact with it.

### Account monitor

On the other hand, the AccountMonitor is responsible for monitoring changes in the accounts associated with the wallet. It also relies on the Notify object to receive notifications about account-related events. The AccountMonitor runs in its own background task using tokio::spawn and has a handle (account_monitor_handle) that can be used to interact with it.

## Key storage security

All data stored by wallet daemon (transactions, resources, etc.) should be encrypted with password to prevent any hostile actor from obtaining confidential data from user's wallet.
According to [RFC-0153](RFC-0153_StagedWalletSecurity.md) users should be able to play around as fast as possible without any sacrifices to the security. Bare minimum setup should require creating a password for encryption and any other actions like writing down recovery phrase and making backups could be done after users decides to do so.

Users will be able to recover and reset their password using their secret recovery phrase in similar way that [metamask allows to recover wallet](https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360039616872-How-can-I-reset-my-password).
