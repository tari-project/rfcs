## Goals

This document describes the specification for Emoji Ids. Emoji Ids are encoded node ids used for humans to verify peer node addresses easily
and for machines to verify that the address is being used in the correct context.

## Description

Tari [Communication Node]s are identified on the network via their [Node ID]; which in turn are derived from the node's
public key. Both the node id and public key are simple large integer numbers.

The most common practice for human beings to copy large numbers in cryptocurrency software is scanning a QR code or copying and pasting a value from one application to another. These numbers are typically encoded using hexadecimal or Base58
encoding. The user will then typically scan (parts) of the string by eye to ensure that the value was transferred
correctly.

For Tari, we propose encoding values, the node ID in particular and masking the network identifier, for Tari, using emojis. The advantages of this approach are:

* Emoji are more easily identifiable; and, if selected carefully, less prone to identification errors (e.g., mistaking an
  O for a 0).
* The alphabet can be considerably larger than hexadecimal (16) or Base58 (58), resulting in shorter character sequences
  in the encoding.
* Should be be able to detect if the address used belongs to the correct network. 
## The specification

### Emoji map
An emoji alphabet of 256 characters is selected. Each emoji is assigned a unique index from 0 to 255 inclusive. The
list of selected emojis is:

The emoji have been selected such that:
* Similar-looking emoji are excluded from the map. For example, neither 😁 or 😄 should be included. Similarly, the Irish and
  Côte d'Ivoire flags look very similar, and both should be excluded.
* Modified emoji (skin tones, gender modifiers) are excluded. Only the "base" emoji are considered.

The selection of an alphabet with 256 symbols means there is a direct mapping between bytes and emoji.

### Encoding

 The emoji ID is calculated from a node public key `B` (serialized as 32 bytes) and a network identifier `N` (serialized as 8 bits) as follows:

* Use the [DammSum](https://github.com/cypherstack/dammsum) algorithm with `k = 8` and `m = 32` to compute an 8-bit checksum `C` using `B` as input.
* Compute the masked checksum `C' = C XOR N`.
* Encode `B` into an emoji string using the emoji map.
* Encode `C'` into an emoji character using the emoji map.
* Concatenate `B` and `C'` as the emoji ID.

The result is 33 emoji characters.

### Decoding

The node public key is obtained from an emoji ID and a network identifier `N` (serialized to 8 bits) as follows:

* Assert that the emoji ID contains exactly 33 valid emoji characters from the emoji alphabet. If not, return an error.
* Decode the emoji ID as an emoji string by mapping each emoji character to a byte value using the emoji map, producing
33 bytes. Let `B` be the first 32 bytes and `C'` be the last byte.
* Compute the unmasked checksum `C = C' XOR N`.
* Use the DammSum validation algorithm on `B` to assert that `C` is the correct checksum. If not, return an error.
* Attempt to deserialize `B` as a public key. If this fails, return an error. If it succeeds, return the public key.

#### Checksum effectiveness
It is important to note that masking the checksum reduces its effectiveness.
Namely, if an emoji ID is presented with a different network identifier, and if there is a transmission error, it is possible for the result to decode in a seemingly valid way with a valid checksum after unmasking.
If both conditions occur randomly, the likelihood of this occurring is `n / 256` for `n` possible network identifiers.

Since emoji ID will typically be copied digitally and therefore not particularly subject to transmission errors, so it seems unlikely for these conditions to coincide in practice.
