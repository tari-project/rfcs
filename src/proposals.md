# Proposals

RFC documents in this section are not part of the Tari specification, and for this reason are not placed in the 
preceding sections. However, they describe useful _applications_ of the Tari protocol that may be built on top of 
the core technology.

RFCs in this section will remain in ![draft](theme/images/status-draft.svg) status until they are implemented in 
some fashion in a wallet, standalone application, or in the RPC protocols, at which point they can be marked as 
![stable](theme/images/status-stable.svg).

If the underlying protocol changes to the point that an application is no longer implementable in its current state, 
it must be updated to ![outdated](theme/images/status-outdated.svg) or else deprecated and moved to the 
[Deprecated RFCs](deprecated.md) chapter.
