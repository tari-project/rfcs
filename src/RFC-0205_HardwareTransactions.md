## Introduction

Hardware wallets are secure physical devices used to protect crypto assets and funds by requiring user interaction from the device.
These devices are used to sign for transactions by keeping all the secrets from the transactions on the hardware device. If
the host machines that run the wallets are compromised by malware the secrets from the transactions are still safe as they are not
kept on the machine as with regular wallets. The devices are very low power and only feature a very limited processing power. MimbleWimble 
has intensive crypto operations that are in some instances very slow or not able to run on the hardware wallet at all. This RFC describes a way to 
get around these limitations to have fully functional secure hardware wallet integration. 

## Background

Vanilla [Mimblewimble] only has a single secret per [UTXO], the blinding factor (\\( k_i \\) ). The Tari protocol extends the [Mimblewimble] protocol to include scripting in the form of [TariScript]. This adds a second secret per [UTXO] called the script_key (\\( k_s \\) ). In practical terms this means that while vanilla [Mimblewimble] only requires that a wallet wishing to spend an [UTXO], prove knowledge of (\\( k_i \\) ) by producing the kernel signature, this is not sufficient for Tari. A Tari wallet must also prove knowledge of the script key (\\( k_s \\) ), by producing the script signature. 

## Requirements

To properly implement hardware wallets we need the following requirements to be met:
* No UTXO can be spent without a user physically approving the transaction on the hardware wallet.
* Users need to verify transaction properties when signing for transactions.
* The user must be able to receive transactions without having to authorize them on the hardware wallet.
* The user must be able to receive transactions without having the Hardware wallet attached.
* The hardware device implementation should comply with the best practices and/or security recommendations of the provider.

## Implementation

### Entities
Normal transactions have only a single entity, the wallet which controls all secrets and transactions. But with hardware wallets, we need to define two distinct entities:
* Signer: This is the entity that keeps the secrets for the transactions and approves them, aka the hardware wallet.
* Helper: This entity is the program that helps the signer construct the transaction, send it over the network and scan the network, aka wallet.

### Process Overview
By splitting the ownership of the [UTXO]'s secrets by assigning knowledge of only the script key (\\( k_s \\) ) to the signer, we can lift much of the heavy cryptography like bulletproof creation to the helper device by exposing (\\( k_i \\) ) to it. By looking at how [one-sided-stealth] transactions are created, we can construct the script key in such a way that the helper can calculate the public script key, but cannot calculate the private script key.

All hardware wallet created [UTXO]s will contain a script `PushPubkey(K_S)`. The key (\\( k_s \\) ) is created as follows:
$$
\begin{align}
k_S &= H(k_i) + a \\\\
K_S &= H(k_i) \cdot G + A
\end{align}
$$

The blinding factor (\\( k_i \\) ) is used as a random nonce when creating the script key. This means the helper can create the public key without the signer present, and the signer can then at a later stage create the private key from the nonce. The key pair (\\( a, A \\) ) is the master key pair from the signer. The private key (\\( a \\) ) is kept secret by the signer at all times.

### Initialization
Adding a hardware wallet to a wallet (helper) we need to ensure that all keys are only derived from a single seed phrase provided by the hardware wallet. 

Helper asks signer for master helper key (\\( k_H \\) ). 
This key is derived from the signer seed phrase.

### Transaction receiving
When a transaction is received the helper constructs the new [UTXO] with its Rangeproof. Choosing a new ( \\( k_i \\) ) for the [UTXO], it calculates a new \\( K_S \\). It attaches the script `PushPubkey(K_S)` to output.

### Transaction sending
When the user wants to send a transaction, the helper retrieves the desired [UTXO]. The helper asks the signer to sign the transaction. 
The signer calculates \\( k_s \\) to sign the transaction. 
The signer creates a random nonce \\( k_O \\) to use for the script_offset. It produces the metadata signature with \\( k_O \\), and supplies the script_offset to the helper. 
The helper can attach the correct signatures to the [UTXO]s and ship the transaction.

### Receiving normal one-sided transaction
This can be done by the helper asking the signer for a public key. And advertising this public key as the destination public key for a 1-sided transaction. 
The helper can scan the blockchain for this public key. 

### Receiving one-sided-stealth
Not yet possible with this this design.

### Output recovery
When creating outputs the wallet encrypts the blinding factor \\(k_i \\) and value \\( v \\) with \\( k_H \\). This is encrypted using extended-nonce AEAD using a random nonce and authenticated decryption.
Because the key \\( k_H \\)  is calculated from the seed phrase of the signer, this will be the same each time. The helper can try to decrypt each scanned output, when it is successful it knows it has found its own output. 
The helper can validate that the commitment is correct using the blinding factor \\(k_i \\) and value \\( v \\). It can also validate (\\( K_S)\\) corresponds to (\\( k_i, A \\) )

## Security
Because the script key is required for spending, it is the only key that needs to be kept secret. 
The following table explains what an attacker can do upon learning a key from the helper

| key         | Worst case scenario          | 
|:------------|:-----------------------------|
| \\( k_H \\) | Can view all transactions and values made by the wallet |
| \\( k_i \\) | Can try and brute force the value of the transaction |

The keys ( \\( a, k_S, k_O \\) ) are only known to the signer, and should never leave the hardware wallet.
