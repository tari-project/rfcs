## Goals

The aim of this Request for Comment (RFC) is to describe the layer 2 code template registration procedure.
Code templates are composable and reusable building blocks that define state and operations on any given
side-chain contract.

Registering these on the base layer accomplishes these goals:

1. Provides a public register of code templates with an immutable notary (the Tari base layer).
2. Provides a source of truth that [Validator Node]s and potentially others can use to ensure the correct code templates are being run.
3. Provides reusable building-blocks available to anyone wishing to build side-chain contracts.
4. Provides other metadata, such as versioning and authorship.

This registration scheme seeks to enable template indexing services and possibly marketplaces for template authors.

## Description

A template author registers a template on the [Base layer] creating a special [UTXO] on the base layer.
The registration [transaction] requires the spending of a certain minimum deposit amount of [Tari coin], in addition to
weighted [UTXO] fees, to discourage spam.

It is helpful to describe what a template is and how it relates to a running side-chain contract. Rather than
being a fully-fledged smart-contract, templates define single-concern state and state-transition functions that can be
composed with other templates and run, by a set of layer 2 [validator node]s.

This RFC is primarily concerned with the mechanism for making these templates available to other parties wishing to
build contracts and run them. The most important aspect of this is to allow any [validator node] to verify that they
are running the same code as other members of the same committee.

## Template Registration UTXO fields

A base-layer template registration [UTXO] MUST have the `TEMPLATE_REGISTRATION` output flag set and contain the following data:

| Name              | Type              | Description                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| author_public_key | ECC public key    | Public key of the author                                                                                                                |
| author_signature  | Schnorr signature | Signature that signs remaining fields                                                                                                   |
| template_id       | 256-bit hash      | Hash of `TEMPLATE_REGISTRATION` fields (see below)                                                                                      |
| template_name     | String (255)      | A descriptive name for the template                                                                                                     |
| template_version  | Varint            | Code version as a single number                                                                                                         |
| build_info        | BuildInfo struct  | Information on the binary build                                                                                                         |
| binary_checksum   | SHA2 checksum     | A SHA2 checksum of the WASM binary.                                                                                                     |
| binary_address    | [Multiaddr]       | A [multiaddr] pointing to the WASM module binary download. This may be an HTTP, ONION, p2p, or IPFS address. Maximum byte length: 255   |

We define the `template_id` as a hash of `author_public_key`, `template_name`, `template_version`, `build_info`, `binary_checksum`, and `binary_address`.
The `author_signature` is a Schnorr proof that commits to the `template_id`.

The base node acts as a notary for this data, it is not responsible for the validity of the template fields. However, it must
not allow malformed/invalid data to be committed to the blockchain.

Therefore, some additional base-layer consensus rules are required for a `TEMPLATE_REGISTRATION` [UTXO]:
* A base node MUST validate the `author_signature`; and
* the `template_id` MUST be unique within the unspent set.

To reference a template within a contract:
* the contract includes a reference to the specific template registration `template_id`.
* Alternative: the `TEMPLATE_REGISTRATION` information is copied into the contract definition [UTXO].

A base node SHOULD NOT check that the `binary_address` points to a valid template binary.

** BuildInfo struct **

| Name        | Type      | Description                                          |
|-------------|-----------|------------------------------------------------------|
| build_image | Url       | A docker build environment used to build the binary  |
| repo_link   | Url       | A public link to the source code repository          |
| commit_hash | SHA2 hash | The commit hash of the code used to build the binary |

The `build_image` field SHOULD contain a link to a publicly-accessible docker image that contains the exact build
environment used to build the binary. The build environment refers to the specific compiler and OS used. Typically,
this will be a docker image with a specific version of the rust compiler, LLVM and the `wasm-unknown-unknown` target
provided by the Tari community.

Anyone wishing to execute the template MAY build the binary themselves and compare checksums.
It's worth noting that identical build environments do not guarantee deterministic builds.
If you're curious about the kinds of issues encountered with deterministic builds using the rust language,
[read this post](https://dev.to/gnunicorn/hunting-down-a-non-determinism-bug-in-our-rust-wasm-build-4fk1).

## Obtaining the Template Binary

The [contract definition] specifies the [binary_checksum] for each template. Once the [validator node] has been
assigned a contract via the [contract definition], the [validator node] performs the following actions to obtain a template:

1. It scans the blockchain for a template matching the `binary_checksum`;
2. it downloads the WASM binary and verifies the checksum and stores the binary and associated registration [UTXO] metadata;
3. a validator node operator may choose to build the binary from source as per `BuildInfo` and use the resulting binary;

In the event that a new validator is added to [contract constitution], but the original template registration is unavailable,
the [validator node] SHOULD make the template available to new committee members. New committee members SHOULD confirm the checksum
with a 2/3 majority of the validator committee to ensure that the correct copy is received.

## Spending the Template Registration UTXO

These cases apply to spending the template registration [UTXO]:
1. The author MAY spend into another template registration [UTXO]
* This effectively withdraws (yanks) the previous version of the template.
* The template name and author SHOULD be identical. This MAY be enforced by covenant.
* The template version number MUST be incremented by one from the version number in the spent input.
* It is RECOMMENDED that live contracts upgrade their definitions to run the new template.
2. The author MAY spend to a "vanilla" [UTXO] to reclaim their deposit.
* This effectively withdraws (yanks) the template.
* The template MAY remain in use on existing contracts. In fact, anyone may now re-register the template.

Alternatives:
* Consensus rule that prevents spending of the template while used by other contracts
* The contract definition may have copy the template binary_checksum etc. Validator nodes may mirror the code for new VNs

## Upgrading a Template

If a [validator node] detects an update to the [contract definition] that includes a template update, the [validator node]
* MUST fetch the new template(s) as per the previous procedure.
